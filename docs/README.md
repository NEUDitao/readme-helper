# Readme Helper
This is a simple CLI to help newer GitHub users to easily be walked through 
the creation of a README file for their projects.

This README was created with the tool.

## Installation
To use this, you'll need a working installation of Python 3, preferably the
latest version. On a *nix system, this can be easily done through a package
manager (brew, apt-get, pacman, etc). On Windows, check out 
[this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to download and install
python, and just get started!

## How to Use
To use, just run the python file (`python make_read_me.py` generally), and
follow the on-screen instructions!

## Examples
What you're reading right now was generated with the tool!

## Built With
  - Python

## Contribute
Just type in a pull request if there's some bug/feature that I could implement
that I missed. This was super quick! (This is just to show all the sections
available in the tool).

## Version History
  - Version 1.0: release

## Acknowledgements/Inspirations
Inspired by the beginning of my time in computer science, when I didn't even
know where to begin with everything. Hopefully this helps at least one person
make a decent README.
